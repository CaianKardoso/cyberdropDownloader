based on https://gitlab.com/Fshy/cyberdrop-downloader,
I can not run this easily, so I tried to make it easy. Sorry, i am very dumb



# How to use

In the terminal, type

```properties
git clone https://github.com/CaianKardoso/cydrop.git cydrop

cd cydrop
```

Then

```properties
yarn install

node app.js
```

After that, you can open in

```
127.0.0.1:4000
```



if you do not understand anything, no panic, install [git](https://git-scm.com/), [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/), then run these lines
